Singapore’s journey towards a digital government commenced in the 1980s, with the establishment of the five-year National Computerisation Plan. Ever since, the nation has seen remarkable progress in conceptualising new visions for its digitalisation. In October 2016, this amounted to the founding of the Government Technology Agency, or GovTech.

## The Heart of Singapore's Digital Transformation

Responsible for the delivery of Singapore’s digital services to the public, GovTech plays a vital role in materialising Singapore’s Smart Nation vision. Its work can be classified into 3 distinct fields: “Products”, “Services”, and “Cybersecurity & Governance”.

The Services and Cybersecurity teams focus on managing technology across government agencies, and ensuring safety and security of government digital structures respectively. Meanwhile, the Products team manages a wider framework of responsibilities - ranging from spearheading Strategic National Projects to managing Whole of Government digital infrastructure. As part of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID), I work under the Products team!

## DSAID

DSAID has worked on all sorts of cool projects - from using AI-based video analytics to identify mosquito larval species, to leveraging BERT language models in building “Ask Jamie”, the memorable virtual assistant implemented across government agencies’ websites. With strength in numbers, DSAID harnesses its team of almost 200 talents to empower data in realising Singapore’s visions of becoming a smart nation.

That being said, I worked as a Data Scientist Intern in a team within DSAID that works at the intersection of data science and consultancy - the Quantitative Strategy team.

## Quantitative Strategy Team

GovTech’s Quantitative Strategy team essentially identifies opportunities for data exploitation amongst public agencies and government statutory boards. In doing so, members scope out data science projects with clear deliverables that are actionable and impactful, and execute them in close iteration with clients. 

It essentially functions as the consultancy division of GovTech - with the end-to-end delivery of meaningful solutions that are data-driven. As part of my 6 month stint with the Quantitative Strategy team, I was mobilised to work on data science projects with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI).

## Job Scope

I can safely say that the scope of my experiences were varied - ranging from building dashboards in Tableau to experimenting with state-of-the-art algorithms in Topic Modelling, a emerging sub-field of Natural Language Processing.

Confidentiality agreements and what-not, I won't go in detail into my specific projects in GovTech. Instead, I'll share some personal takeaways - from technical to personal!

## Technical Takeaway #1: The Myth of the Full-Stack Data Scientist

My undergraduate studies in Data Science at NUS equipped me with a strong foundation in central components of the Data Science pipeline - from data cleaning to building machine learning models. Two months into working at GovTech, I learned that there is more to data science than importing pandas and sklearn.

I learned that consultancy firms often except their data scientists to be full-stack. It's an implicit expectation that no one tells you about. Oftentimes, a proof-of-concept and models written in Jupyter notebook will only get you so far. My time at GovTech was my first real exposure to the end-to-end Data Science pipeline.

At GovTech, I had the fortune of building my model into production in the form of a web application. This was an intimidating experience for me - I'd never touched model deployment tools like Flask or Heroku before, let alone considered what else goes into monitoring an app over time. Fortunately, my teammates showed me Streamlit - an extremely intuitive, Python-based library to write web applications. With my teammates supervision and client's feedback, I managed to build and deploy my first ever multi-page stateful web application for the mobilisation of our NLP model.

Moving forward, I'm hoping to work more closely with the prologue and epilogue of the Data Science pipeline - picking up skills in Database Systems, Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning Operations!

## Technical Takeaway #2: The Value of Software Engineering

In no way did I expect one of my major takeaways from my internship as a “Data Scientist Intern” to be in Software Engineering. Nonetheless, my experiences in building models for production taught me the importance of writing optimised, reproducible and modular code.

The hardest part for me, without a doubt, was attempting to write & understand code written in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I don't know what it is about OOP, but it is my absolute worst nightmare. I spent hours trying to reconcile differences between abstraction and inheritance, and place distinctions between class functions & static functions. I'm still no expert at OOP - but I'm working on it!

I also learned the value of writing explicit documentation and version control using Git. As pointless as it may feel when you're committing changes to your repository after changing a mere single line in your code - believe me when I say you'll thank yourself for it later. Likewise for writing documentation - it's a drag but it's worth it.

## Business Wisdom #1: Agile

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and product development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster by being responsive to changes. In consultancy, this necessitates a keen user-feedback loop with one’s client - whether through regular prototype demonstrations or user testing opportunities. GovTech prides itself on upholding an Agile developmental framework as one of its core values.

On a personal level, I initially had difficulties grasping the concept of an ‘Agile’ approach. I have always been one to favour the big picture - and often feel the need to see the vision for a project that I embark on. While this is usually a strength that allows me to closely tune myself to the requirements of a project, it can be a weakness at times as well. It renders me anxious and overwhelmed when I am unable to see a clear direction as to where the project is headed. This is not the best trait to have when in the field of Data Science - a field that is fraught with uncertainty, and depends entirely on continuous developments in how the analysis or modelling of a particular dataset is progressing.

My work in the Quantitative Strategy team helped me face and (gradually) overcome my struggles with adaptability - building my confidence and flexibility towards sudden changes. I realised how valuable an iterative workflow is - especially in fostering a relationship of mutual trust and sincere listening between a client and a data scientist.

## My...Future?

In university, I learned fairly early that I want to be a Data Scientist. I loved working in an interdisciplinary field amalgamating computing, business, and storytelling. However, I never really knew what kind of industry I wanted to contribute my efforts to.

Having spent 5 months working at the intersection of consulting, the public sector, and data science, I can confidently and genuinely say that I hope to continue along this interdisciplinary trajectory.

I loved learning about my colleagues’ work - from modelling students’ academic performances to identify and help low-performing students, to visualising Singapore’s efforts in combating climate change. It nurtured my excitement in collaborating with various public agencies on diverse use cases - from labour policies to urban technology - on projects targeting social impact.

Working with agencies with limited resources for in-house technological advancement was extremely meaningful. I was proud to play a role in the digital transformation of our public sector clients.

Ultimately, my time at GovTech inspired my interest in working in the coalescence of data and clients, on projects targeting social impact. Of course, the road ahead will be rocky and filled with twists and turns - who really knows what's coming?

## Parting Thoughts

That's all from me! In all seriousness, I've learned a lot about myself these past couple of months. I'm grateful to GovTech for its unconscious contributions towards my ongoing journey towards self-discovery. On to the next journey!
